Hi! I'm Richard Shan, a Fab Academy 2024 alumnus. I currently am a member of the class of 2026 at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) in Durham, NC, where I am studying computer science and researching generative AI.

I have significant experience both in academia and industry. I've worked as a generative AI researcher and developer in corporate, and have created many research projects and academic publications. I am very experienced in NLP, LLM fine tuning, developing RAG systems, building evaluation models, SLMs, building ML models, feature engineering, synthetic data generation and cleaning, and working with vector databases. Recently, I've been working a lot with RAGAS and ARES. My current project centers on dynamic RAG optimization and eval.

I have learned a lot about digital fabrication during Fab Academy, and have applied my CS skills in the engineering space. This is exemplified in my machine week project, where I handled the software development. Through building an advanced program and combining it with hardware components, we produced an impressive product. Additionally, my later weeks and final project are also pretty heavily software-oriented. I had a lot of fun exploring the intersection between programming and engineering, and how they work together to implement a solution. I applied my Fab Academy skills to NCSSM's annual hackathon, and [**won**](https://devpost.com/software/ares-udeksp) first place building an integrated environmental sensing station.

In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and debating. I am an active member of my local Ultimate community, helping in hosting tournaments and attending leagues and events on weekends. I also play for my city's premier nationally-ranked high school men's ultimate team (Charlotte Flight), and I have captained Charlotte's U17 men's ultimate team (Queen City Fury). I also captain my school's ultimate team on the field along with managing its logistics, and won the D2 2024 NC State Championships. I am also an avid debater, being consistently ranked in the top 20 high school public forum debaters nationwide.

Many thanks to Charlotte Latin, Fab Foundation, 1517 Fund, and Bowman-Brockman Endowment for support on my final project.
